# Cubytes-Godot

## Description
Essentially a remake of Cubytes with the Chili Framework. I'll be adding new features to it as time goes on and hopefully by the end of it create a full-featured game.

## Running
To run it essentially just open the **"project.godot"** file in Godot 3.0+. Should bulid itself, provided I didn't screw everything up.
