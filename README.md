# Cubytes-Godot

## Description
Essentially a remake of Cubytes with Godot 3.0.2, instead of the Chili Framework. I'll be adding new features to it as time goes on and hopefully by the end of it create a full-featured game.

## Running
To run it, open the **"project.godot"** file in Godot 3.0.2+. Should bulid itself, provided I didn't screw everything up.

## License
Cubytes-Godot is under a MIT license. This means that you can share the program, but please keep in mind that:
* The only place for the source code is here.
* I (Battlefrog) still maintain the copyright, so you should respect it.
