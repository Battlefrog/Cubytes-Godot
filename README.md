## Media

## Description
A remake of Cubytes with Godot 3.0.2, instead of the Chili Framework. I'll be adding new features to it as time goes on and hopefully by the end of it create a full-featured game.

## Running
To run it, open the **"project.godot"** file in Godot 3.0.2+. Should bulid itself, provided I didn't screw everything up.
